IBIS, FIRS, SPINOR, and ROSA reduction tools.

This is the set of tools for reducing IBIS, FIRS, SPINOR, and ROSA data from the Dunn Solar Telescope. The tools were written by various authors. The directory structure remains the same as when the tools were delivered to SSOC by Christian Beck, National Solar Observatory.
